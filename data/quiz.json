Unlike traditional blockchains (like Ethereum) that are limited to rigid code, GenLayer integrates AI (Artificial Intelligence) directly at the protocol level.\n\nKey Differences:\n\nWeb Access: Traditional chains need 'oracles' (middlemen) to see the internet. GenLayer contracts can fetch live web data natively.\n\nLanguage: GenLayer uses Python, making it accessible to millions of developers, unlike Solidity which is niche.\n\nUnderstanding: These contracts can understand natural language (human commands), not just binary code.",
